**Generated:** 2025-08-08  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-08

## Overview

This discussion focuses on establishing a comprehensive documentation strategy to automate the generation of project-related documents directly from GitHub discussions. The goal is to reduce manual documentation overhead, maintain consistent formatting, and ensure stakeholders have access to up-to-date information. Chroniclr, a tool for automated documentation generation, is proposed as the solution to address current challenges such as outdated documents, inconsistent formatting, and lost decisions in chat threads.

## Objectives

- Automate documentation generation from GitHub discussions.
- Maintain consistent formatting across all project documentation.
- Reduce manual documentation overhead by 80%.
- Ensure all stakeholders have access to up-to-date and accurate information.

## Current Status

- **Progress:** 40%  
- **Phase:** Initial Setup and Testing  
- **Next Milestone:** Begin testing with sample discussions (Due: Aug 12)

## Key Stakeholders

- **Sarah Chen (Engineering Lead):** Focused on security and review processes for sensitive information.  
- **Alex Rodriguez (Project Manager):** Advocates for integration with existing tools and tracking stakeholder satisfaction.  
- **Jamie Park (Design):** Emphasizes consistent formatting, accessibility compliance, and user experience improvements.  
- **Michael Henke (Discussion Author):** Leading the initiative and coordinating action items.

### Key Insights and Decisions

1. **Security Concerns:**  
   - Sensitive information in discussions must be handled carefully.  
   - Proposed solutions include a `@chroniclr-skip` tag to exclude certain discussions and a whitelist of "safe" discussion labels for auto-generation.  

2. **Integration Requests:**  
   - Slack notifications for newly generated documents.  
   - Compatibility with Confluence and project roadmap tools.  

3. **Design and Accessibility:**  
   - Mobile-responsive templates and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance are priorities.  
   - Preview mode for generated documents to allow edits before publishing.  

4. **Metrics to Track:**  
   - Time to documentation (discussion → published doc).  
   - Stakeholder satisfaction scores.  
   - Reduction in outdated project information.  

5. **Proposed Features:**  
   - Auto-generated diagrams for process flows.  
   - Screenshot embedding for UI discussions.  
   - Brand-consistent headers, footers, and style guides.
