# Initiative Brief: Enhanced Template System Initiative

**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Owner:** @mhenke  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** High  

---

## Problem Statement

The current documentation templates are too basic and fail to capture the full context required for complex projects. Teams are spending significant time manually formatting and organizing generated documents, which reduces efficiency and leads to inconsistent documentation quality.

---

## Proposed Solution

Develop an enhanced template system with the following features:

### Smart Templates
- Conditional sections based on project type and discussion labels.
- Dynamic stakeholder identification using Git history and discussion content.
- Automatic cross-referencing between related documents.
- Context-aware formatting tailored for different audiences.

### Template Features
- **Adaptive Sections:** Automatically show or hide content based on discussion metadata.
- **Smart Variables:** Auto-populate fields using repository metadata and analytics.
- **Rich Formatting:** Support for tables, charts, and diagrams.
- **Version Tracking:** Maintain a history of template evolution for audit and improvement.

### Technical Architecture
1. **Template Engine:** Handles variable substitution and conditional logic (e.g., Handlebars.js or Liquid).
2. **Context Analyzer:** Extracts metadata from repositories for smart variable population.
3. **Cross-Reference Manager:** Maintains links between related documents.
4. **Format Renderer:** Outputs templates in multiple formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML).

---

## Success Criteria

- Templates automatically adapt to project context with minimal manual intervention.
- 90% reduction in manual document formatting time.
- Cross-references between documents are automatically maintained and updated.
- Template quality improves over time through machine learning feedback mechanisms.

## Resource Requirements

### Team Members
- **1 Senior Developer:** Responsible for the template engine implementation.
- **1 ML Engineer:** Focused on smart features like stakeholder detection and adaptive sections.
- **1 Technical Writer:** Designs templates and ensures readability for all stakeholders.

### Technical Requirements
- Handlebars.js or Liquid for template logic.
- GraphQL API for repository metadata extraction.
- Redis for caching processed templates.
- GitHub Actions for automated template regeneration.

### Budget/Resources
- Access to repository analytics API.
- Compute resources for machine learning model training and inference.

---

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk:** Template complexity may make maintenance difficult.  
  **Mitigation:** Start with simple features and iterate based on user feedback.
  
- **Risk:** Performance issues with large repositories.  
  **Mitigation:** Implement caching (Redis and in-memory) and lazy loading for metadata.
  
- **Risk:** Low user adoption of new template syntax.  
  **Mitigation:** Maintain backward compatibility and provide comprehensive training materials.

---

## Dependencies

- Repository analytics API access for metadata extraction.
- Enhanced Claude Code agent capabilities for advanced ML features.
- Integration with existing GitHub Actions workflows for automation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Template engine supports conditional logic.
- [ ] Smart variables work with at least five repository types.
- [ ] Cross-references between documents update automatically.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<2 seconds generation time).
- [ ] Documentation and training materials are complete.
