# Meeting Notes: Project Documentation Strategy

**Date:** August 8, 2025  
**Time:** 5:30 PM UTC  
**Meeting Type:** Strategy Discussion

## Attendees

- **mhenke** (Discussion Author, Engineering)  
- **Sarah Chen** (Engineering Lead)  
- **Alex Rodriguez** (Project Manager)  
- **Jamie Park** (Design Lead)

## Agenda

1. Discuss challenges with current project documentation processes  
2. Review proposed approach for automating documentation using Chroniclr  
3. Gather feedback from stakeholders on implementation and features  
4. Define success criteria and next steps  

## Discussion Summary

The discussion focused on addressing inefficiencies in the current documentation process, including time-consuming manual updates, inconsistent formatting, and outdated information. Chroniclr was proposed as a solution to automate documentation generation directly from GitHub discussions, with a focus on maintaining consistency and reducing overhead.

Key points raised:  
- **Security Concerns:** Sensitive information in discussions requires a review process or exclusion mechanism.  
- **Integration Opportunities:** Slack notifications and Confluence integration were suggested.  
- **Customization Needs:** Stakeholders requested customizable templates for different project types.  
- **Design Consistency:** Emphasis on creating visually consistent, mobile-responsive, and accessible templates.  
- **Metrics to Track:** Time savings, stakeholder satisfaction, and reduction in outdated documentation were identified as key success metrics.

## Decisions Made

1. Implement a `@chroniclr-skip` tag to exclude sensitive discussions from auto-documentation.  
2. Develop a security review process for auto-generated documents, including manual approval for sensitive labels.  
3. Prioritize integration with Slack for notifications and explore Confluence compatibility.  
4. Create customizable, mobile-responsive, and WCAG-compliant templates for generated documents.  
5. Track success metrics, including time to documentation, stakeholder satisfaction, and outdated document reduction.

## Action Items

## Next Steps

1. Begin testing Chroniclr with discussions #1-3 to validate the automated generation workflow.  
2. Finalize and implement the security review process.  
3. Develop and test customizable templates for different project types.  
4. Conduct team training sessions on discussion labeling and Chroniclr usage.  

## Follow-up Items

- Monitor and refine templates based on team feedback during the testing phase.  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the `@chroniclr-skip` tag and adjust as needed.  
- Assess stakeholder satisfaction after initial implementation and iterate on the process.
