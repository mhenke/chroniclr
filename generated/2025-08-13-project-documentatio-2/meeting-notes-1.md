**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Meeting Type:** Strategy Planning

## Attendees

## Agenda

1. Discuss the need for a comprehensive documentation strategy.  
2. Review current challenges in project documentation.  
3. Propose the use of Chroniclr for automated documentation.  
4. Gather stakeholder feedback.  
5. Define success criteria and action items.  

## Discussion Summary

Michael Henke (@mhenke) initiated the discussion by emphasizing the need for a robust documentation strategy to address inefficiencies in manual documentation. The team reviewed the current challenges, including time-consuming processes, outdated documents, and inconsistent formatting. 

The proposed solution involves using Chroniclr to automate the generation of project summaries, initiative briefs, meeting notes, and changelogs. Stakeholders provided feedback on sensitive content handling, version control, and template customization. Recent updates on the project were shared, and action items were outlined to move forward.

## Decisions Made

1. Use Chroniclr to automate documentation generation for all projects.  
2. Implement a review process for sensitive content in auto-generated documents.  
3. Customize templates for different project types.  
4. Integrate version control and ensure compatibility with the existing wiki.
