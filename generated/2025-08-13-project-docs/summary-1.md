## Overview

The team is working to establish a comprehensive documentation strategy to address inefficiencies in manual documentation processes. The proposed approach leverages automation tools, specifically Chroniclr, to generate consistent, up-to-date project documentation directly from discussions. This initiative aims to reduce manual effort, ensure uniform formatting, and maintain the accuracy of project information for all stakeholders.

---

## Objectives

- Automate documentation generation from discussions.
- Maintain consistent formatting across all project documentation.
- Reduce manual documentation overhead by 80%.
- Ensure all stakeholders have access to up-to-date information.

## Current Status

- **Progress:** 60%  
- **Phase:** Testing and Training  
- **Next Milestone:** Complete testing with sample discussions by August 12, 2023.
