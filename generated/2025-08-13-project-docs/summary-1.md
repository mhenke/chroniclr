## Overview

The team is working on implementing a comprehensive documentation strategy to address inefficiencies in manual documentation processes. The proposed solution involves leveraging Chroniclr to automate the generation of project documentation directly from discussions, ensuring consistent formatting, reducing manual overhead, and keeping all stakeholders informed with up-to-date information.

## Objectives

- Automate documentation generation from discussions.
- Maintain consistent formatting across all project documentation.
- Reduce manual documentation overhead by 80%.
- Ensure all stakeholders have access to up-to-date information.

## Current Status

- **Progress:** 50%  
- **Phase:** Testing and Configuration  
- **Next Milestone:** Testing with sample discussions (Due: August 12, 2023)

## Key Stakeholders
