## Overview

The team is working to establish a comprehensive documentation strategy aimed at automating the generation of project-related documents. This initiative seeks to address current challenges such as time-intensive manual documentation, outdated information, and inconsistent formatting. The proposed solution involves leveraging Chroniclr to automate the creation of summaries, briefs, meeting notes, and changelogs directly from project discussions. This approach is expected to significantly reduce manual effort, maintain consistency, and ensure all stakeholders have access to up-to-date information.

## Objectives

- Automate documentation generation from discussions.

- Ensure all stakeholders have access to up-to-date information.
