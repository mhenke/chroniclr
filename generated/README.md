# Generated Documentation

This folder contains all documentation automatically generated by Chroniclr, organized by date and AI-generated topic:

## Folder Structure

Generated folders follow the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic`

Examples:
- **`2025-01-13-auth-system/`** - Authentication system related documents
- **`2025-01-13-mobile-ui/`** - Mobile UI and interface documents  
- **`2025-01-14-bug-fixes/`** - Bug fix and maintenance documents
- **`2025-01-15-database/`** - Database and performance related documents
- **`2025-01-15-database-2/`** - Second database-related request same day

## How Topics Are Generated

Topics are generated using AI analysis of all content:
- **Discussion titles** - "User Authentication System" → `auth-system`
- **PR titles** - "Fix mobile login bug" → `mobile-fix`  
- **Issue titles** - "Database performance issues" → `database`
- **Jira summaries** - "Payment gateway integration" → `payment`

Topics are:
- ✅ 1-2 words maximum (scannable)
- ✅ Lowercase with hyphens  
- ✅ Generated from content, not data source
- ✅ Automatically versioned if conflicts exist
