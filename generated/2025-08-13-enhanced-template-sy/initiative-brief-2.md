# Initiative Brief: Enhanced Template System Initiative

**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Owner:** @mhenke  
**Status:** Draft  
**Priority:** High  

---

## Problem Statement

Our current documentation templates are basic and fail to capture the full context needed for complex projects. Teams are spending significant time manually formatting and organizing generated documents, which reduces efficiency and increases the risk of inconsistencies.

---

## Proposed Solution

Develop an enhanced template system with the following features:

### Smart Templates
- Conditional sections based on project type.
- Dynamic stakeholder identification from Git history.
- Automatic cross-referencing between related documents.
- Context-aware formatting tailored to different audiences.

### Template Features
- **Adaptive Sections:** Show/hide content based on discussion labels.
- **Smart Variables:** Auto-populate fields using repository metadata.
- **Rich Formatting:** Support for tables, charts, and diagrams.
- **Version Tracking:** Maintain a history of template evolution.

### Technical Architecture
1. **Template Engine:** Handles variable substitution and conditional logic (using Handlebars.js).
2. **Context Analyzer:** Extracts relevant metadata from the repository via a GraphQL API.
3. **Cross-Reference Manager:** Maintains links between related documents.
4. **Format Renderer:** Outputs to multiple formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML).

---

## Success Criteria

- Templates automatically adapt to project context.
- 90% reduction in manual document formatting.
- Cross-references are automatically maintained.
- Template quality improves over time through machine learning feedback.

## Resource Requirements

### Team Members
- **1 Senior Developer:** Responsible for building the template engine.
- **1 Machine Learning Engineer:** Focused on implementing smart features.
- **1 Technical Writer:** Designs and tests the new templates.

### Technical Requirements
- Access to repository analytics API.
- Redis for caching processed templates.
- GitHub Actions for automated template regeneration.

### Budget/Resources
- Estimated budget for development tools and team resources: $50,000.
- Additional funds for training and documentation: $10,000.

---

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk:** Template complexity makes maintenance difficult.  
  **Mitigation:** Start with simple features and iterate based on usage feedback.

- **Risk:** Performance impact on large repositories.  
  **Mitigation:** Implement caching and lazy loading mechanisms.

- **Risk:** User adoption of new template syntax.  
  **Mitigation:** Maintain backward compatibility and provide comprehensive training materials.

---

## Dependencies

- Repository analytics API access.
- Enhanced Claude Code agent capabilities.
- Integration with the existing GitHub Actions workflow.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Template engine supports conditional logic.
- [ ] Smart variables work with 5+ repository types.
- [ ] Cross-references update automatically.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<2s generation time).
- [ ] Documentation and training materials are complete.

---

## Next Steps

1. Finalize the technical design and architecture.
2. Assign team members to their respective roles.
3. Begin Phase 1: Design new template architecture.
4. Schedule regular check-ins to monitor progress.
