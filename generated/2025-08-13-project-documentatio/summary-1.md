## Overview

This document outlines the proposed strategy for automating and improving project documentation using Chroniclr. The goal is to address inefficiencies in manual documentation processes, ensure consistency in formatting, and maintain up-to-date records across all project documentation. The strategy leverages Chroniclr to generate summaries, briefs, meeting notes, and changelogs directly from GitHub discussions.

The discussion, titled [Project Documentation Strategy](https://github.com/mhenke/chroniclr/discussions/1), was initiated by @mhenke and has garnered six comments from key stakeholders. The initiative aims to reduce manual documentation overhead by 80% and ensure that all stakeholders have access to accurate and timely information.
