## Overview

The "Project Documentation Strategy" initiative aims to address the inefficiencies and inconsistencies in project documentation by automating the generation of key documents using Chroniclr. This approach will streamline workflows, ensure up-to-date information, and significantly reduce manual documentation overhead. The strategy focuses on creating summaries, briefs, meeting notes, and changelogs directly from discussions, while maintaining consistent formatting and addressing security concerns.

## Objectives

- Automate documentation generation from discussions.
- Maintain consistent formatting across all project documentation.
