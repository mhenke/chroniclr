## Overview

The team is working on establishing a comprehensive documentation strategy to streamline the creation and maintenance of project documentation. The proposed approach leverages Chroniclr to automate the generation of key documents such as project summaries, initiative briefs, meeting notes, and changelogs. This initiative aims to reduce manual documentation overhead, ensure consistent formatting, and provide stakeholders with up-to-date information.

## Objectives

- Automate documentation generation from discussions.
- Maintain consistent formatting across all project documentation.
- Reduce manual documentation overhead by 80%.
- Ensure all stakeholders have access to up-to-date information.

## Current Status

- **Progress:** Initial setup and template creation completed; testing phase scheduled.  
- **Phase:** Testing and refinement.  
- **Next Milestone:** Begin testing with discussions 1-3 to validate the automated generation workflow (Due: Aug 12).

## Key Stakeholders

- **Sarah Chen (Engineering Lead):** Supports the initiative but emphasizes the need for a review process to handle sensitive information.  
- **Alex Rodriguez (PM):** Advocates for automation and suggests integrating version control with the existing wiki.  
- **Jamie Park (Design):** Highlights the importance of consistent formatting and requests customizable templates for different project types.
