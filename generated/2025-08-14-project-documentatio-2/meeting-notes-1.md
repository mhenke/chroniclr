## Agenda

1. Discuss challenges with current project documentation practices  
2. Propose an automated documentation strategy using Chroniclr  
3. Gather stakeholder feedback  
4. Define success criteria and next steps  

## Discussion Summary

Michael Henke presented the need for a comprehensive documentation strategy to address inefficiencies in the current process. Chroniclr was proposed as a solution to automate documentation generation, ensuring consistency, reducing manual effort, and keeping information up-to-date. Stakeholders provided feedback on sensitive data handling, version control, and template customization.

### Key Points Discussed:
- Objectives include automating documentation, maintaining consistent formatting, and reducing manual effort by 80%.  
- Current challenges include time-intensive manual documentation, outdated documents, and inconsistent formatting.  
- Chroniclr will be used to generate project summaries, initiative briefs, meeting notes, and changelogs automatically.  
- Success criteria were defined, including a 5-minute generation time, consistent templates, and zero outdated documents.  

## Decisions Made

1. Proceed with testing Chroniclr for automated documentation generation.  
2. Develop a review process for sensitive content in auto-generated documents.  
3. Customize templates for different project types.
