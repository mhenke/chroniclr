# Initiative Brief: Enhanced Template System Initiative

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Owner:** mhenke  
**Status:** Draft  
**Priority:** High

## Problem Statement

Our current documentation templates are basic and fail to capture the full context required for complex projects. As a result, teams are spending significant time manually formatting and organizing generated documents, which impacts productivity and consistency.

---

## Proposed Solution

To address the limitations of the current system, we propose developing an enhanced template system with the following features:

### Smart Templates
- **Conditional Sections**: Dynamically include or exclude sections based on the project type or discussion labels.
- **Dynamic Stakeholder Identification**: Automatically identify stakeholders using Git history and commit analysis.
- **Automatic Cross-Referencing**: Seamlessly link related documents for better navigation.
- **Context-Aware Formatting**: Adapt templates for different audiences (e.g., technical vs. non-technical stakeholders).

### Template Features
- **Adaptive Sections**: Show/hide content based on discussion labels or metadata.
- **Smart Variables**: Auto-populate fields using repository metadata (e.g., project name, contributors).
- **Rich Formatting**: Support for advanced elements like tables, charts, and diagrams.
- **Version Tracking**: Maintain a history of template changes for auditing and improvement.

### Technical Architecture
1. **Template Engine**: Handles variable substitution and conditional logic (proposed: Handlebars.js).
2. **Context Analyzer**: Extracts relevant metadata from repositories via GraphQL API.
3. **Cross-Reference Manager**: Maintains and updates links between related documents.
4. **Format Renderer**: Outputs templates in multiple formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML).

## Success Criteria

- Templates automatically adapt to project context with minimal manual intervention.
- Achieve a 90% reduction in manual document formatting efforts.
- Cross-references between related documents are automatically maintained and updated.
- Template quality improves over time through machine learning feedback mechanisms.

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                | Mitigation Strategy                                      |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Template complexity increases maintenance difficulty. | Start with simple features and iterate based on user feedback. |
| Performance impact on large repositories.             | Implement caching and lazy loading to optimize performance. |
| Low user adoption of new template syntax.             | Maintain backward compatibility with existing templates. |

---

## Dependencies

- Repository analytics API access for metadata extraction.
- Enhanced Claude Code agent for advanced template features.
- Integration with GitHub Actions for automated workflows.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Template engine supports conditional logic and dynamic sections.
- [ ] Smart variables are functional across at least five repository types.
- [ ] Cross-references between related documents update automatically.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met (e.g., <2s template generation time).
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and training materials are available.

---

## Next Steps

1. Finalize the technical design and architecture for the enhanced template system.
2. Assign team members to specific tasks based on their expertise.
3. Begin development of the smart variable system and conditional logic.
4. Schedule regular stakeholder reviews to ensure alignment with project goals.
5. Prepare documentation and training materials for end-users.
