# Initiative Brief: Enhanced Template System Initiative

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Owner:** mhenke  
**Status:** Draft  
**Priority:** High

## Problem Statement

Our current documentation templates are basic and fail to capture the full context required for complex projects. As a result, teams are spending significant time manually formatting and organizing generated documents, which reduces efficiency and increases the likelihood of errors.

---

## Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, we propose the development of an enhanced template system with the following features:

### Smart Templates
- **Conditional Sections:** Automatically include or exclude sections based on the project type or discussion labels.
- **Dynamic Stakeholder Identification:** Extract stakeholder information from Git history and repository metadata.
- **Automatic Cross-Referencing:** Maintain links between related documents for seamless navigation.
- **Context-Aware Formatting:** Tailor document formatting to suit different audiences (e.g., technical vs. non-technical stakeholders).

### Template Features
- **Adaptive Sections:** Dynamically show or hide content based on metadata or discussion labels.
- **Smart Variables:** Automatically populate fields using repository metadata.
- **Rich Formatting:** Support for tables, charts, and diagrams to enhance document readability.
- **Version Tracking:** Maintain a history of template changes for auditability and iterative improvement.

### Technical Architecture
1. **Template Engine:** Utilizes Handlebars.js for variable substitution and conditional logic.
2. **Context Analyzer:** Extracts relevant metadata from the repository using a GraphQL API.
3. **Cross-Reference Manager:** Automatically manages links between related documents.
4. **Format Renderer:** Outputs documents in multiple formats, including Markdown (MD), PDF, and HTML.

## Success Criteria

- Templates automatically adapt to project context without manual intervention.
- Achieve a 90% reduction in manual document formatting efforts.
- Cross-references between related documents are automatically maintained and updated.
- Template quality improves over time through machine learning (ML) feedback mechanisms.

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                      | Mitigation Strategy                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Template complexity makes maintenance difficult | Start with simple features and iterate based on user feedback. |
| Performance impact on large repositories  | Implement caching and lazy loading mechanisms.      |
| User adoption of new template syntax      | Maintain backward compatibility and provide training materials. |

## Dependencies

- Repository analytics API access for metadata extraction.
- Enhanced Claude Code agent capabilities for advanced ML features.
- Integration with existing GitHub Actions workflows to automate document generation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Template engine supports conditional logic and adaptive sections.
- [ ] Smart variables are functional across at least five repository types.
- [ ] Cross-references between related documents are automatically updated.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met, with document generation times under 2 seconds.
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and training materials are available for end-users.

---

## Next Steps

1. Finalize the design of the enhanced template architecture.
2. Assign team members to specific development tasks.
3. Begin implementation of the smart variable system.
4. Schedule regular progress reviews to ensure alignment with goals.
5. Prepare training materials and documentation for the production rollout.
