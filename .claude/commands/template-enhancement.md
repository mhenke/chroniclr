## Smart Template Features

### Context-Aware Content Generation
```handlebars
{{#if project.isNewProject}}
## Getting Started
This is a new project initiative. Here are the key next steps:
{{#each initialSteps}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

{{#if project.hasExistingCodebase}}
## Technical Context
Building on existing codebase at {{project.repository}}
Key components: {{join project.components ", "}}
{{/if}}

{{#unless stakeholders.technical}}
*Note: Technical stakeholders to be identified*
{{/unless}}
```

### Adaptive Sections
- **Risk Assessment**: Include only if risks are identified
- **Timeline Details**: Show when specific dates are available
- **Resource Requirements**: Display when team capacity data exists
- **Success Metrics**: Include when measurable outcomes are defined
- **Implementation Plan**: Show detailed steps for technical projects

### Template Learning System
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which sections are most/least valuable
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback to improve templates
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful template patterns
- **A/B Testing**: Experiment with template variations
- **Continuous Improvement**: Automatically refine templates based on outcomes
